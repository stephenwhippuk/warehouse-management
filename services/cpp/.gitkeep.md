## Common Structure

Each service directory will follow this structure:
```

├── include/           # Header files
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
├── CMakeLists.txt     # Build configuration
├── Dockerfile         # Container image
└── README.md          # Service documentation
```

## Next Steps

1. Create individual service directories
2. Set up CMake build system
3. Implement service logic
